# dynamic-memory

This dynamic memory allocation program uses a first-fit algorithm for memory allocation, in the preliminary implementation, aiming to allocate memory blocks based on the first available slot that meets the requested size. In its new implementation, the program transitions to a best-fit algorithm, enhancing efficiency by allocating memory blocks that most closely match the requested size among all available slots. This change results in a more optimized memory allocation process, reducing wastage and improving overall memory utilization.
